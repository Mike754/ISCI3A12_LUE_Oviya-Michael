# so we can get the total sum of one row or column of pixels. 
# now, we need a way to sum across rows and columns, i.e. diagonals. 
# let's try: [1,1]+[2,2]+[3,3]..... sum(i,i) for (i,j)
# This one is really easy .. it's the trace! 
# here is the numpy function: 
# numpy.trace(a, offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1, dtype=None, out=None)  
# before, we could just remove the nans, but now we want to keep the array's dimensions. 
# we'll use numpy.nan_to_num and numpy.abs

"with offset", Offset)

# so the offset moves the trace "up" and "down" - as in the trace "angle" stays the same, 
# but the first point being summed moves up or down a column. 
# I could also get the "anti-trace" by using np.flip and taking the trace there. 
# now, I can get 4 different lines crossing the center of the image. 
# still not sure how to change the angles.
